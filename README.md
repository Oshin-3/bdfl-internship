# Hiring Tracker

## Requirements
We are facing issues in tracking the hiring requests across the organization for the projects and the responses and status of the same from the hiring team. So, we need a digital platform where the people can request their need of the resources and the hiring team can work on the same while updating the status regularly.

## Solution
In the existing ERP product of the organization, we can build a new module named Hiring. Because the requests of resources are to the projects/teams, only Managers will have the access to create the hiring requests. Hiring team is notified of the requests and they can start working on them while updating the status every time there is an update. So, the hiring requests will be transparent across the organization and easy to track each of their status on demand.
